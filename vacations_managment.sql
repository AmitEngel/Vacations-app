The air is free spirited here, without the political strains felt in Jerusalem, rightfully nicknamed the \'Bubble\' by its locals. A mix of a business centre, an art hub and a beach town, Tel Aviv is the strange combination of hip and homely.  Cosmopolitan and exuberant Tel Aviv, is Israel\'s pride. The city is now known for its International Style or Bahaus architecture, the renowned White City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The old Jaffa Port, the Meditarranean coastline, the Carmel Market all add to the fervour of this charming city. The locals are politically and socially liberal, there even exists a thriving gay scene. The high end restaurants complement the old school eating joints, some days are for the beach others are for chic cafes, some evenings are for art galleries, others are for outdoor bike paths - Tel Aviv is that strange medley, a heterogenous mix, yet very homogenously absorbed. With theatres, concert halls and a live jazz scene, the city is a lot about culture and aesthetics.

Located on the central western side of the Italian peninsula, the city was founded on the shores of the river Tiber and has an independent country, the Vatican City, within it\'s borders. The city occupies a central position in Western history, as is populated with nearly as many historical and cultural attractions as it has people.Â¾\r\n\r\nHistorically, Rome could arguably be called the cradle of Western civilization. Capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman empire, the city has since become the 14th-most visited country in the world, and a UNESCO Heritage site. You can see the power and might of the erstwhile Roman empire in the ruins of the Colosseum, or revel in the architectural finery at Palatine Hill. The beauty of the artefacts at the Vatican museums are unparalleled and no one can leave Rome without seeing the Sistine Chapel! A visit to the Vatican itself would lay bare the deep Christian roots of the city, while the more adventurous sort have whatever is in the catacombs of San Calisto waiting for discovery! Italian is the most spoken language in the city.

The other super famous area of Vegas is Downtown, which quite like the Strip is beautifully lit up the entire time, except for the light and sound show in the Fremont Street Experience on a curved LED roof stretching over the entire promenade! From Titanic Artifact Exhibition, Mob museum to the stunning views of Keystone Thrust and Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area, Las Vegas has everything from historical places to modern businesses.

Amidst the old cityâs maze-like alleyways is the 1627-built Durbar Square, where locals frolic during Indra Jatra masked dance festival. Swayambhunath Stupa, Pashupatinath Temple, Monkey Temple and Boudha Stupa are some more eminent religious establishments. Outdoor enthusiasts flock to Nagarkot, Rani Pokhari Lake and Champadevi Hill for hiking, bungee jumping, rafting and mountain climbing. Learning about Buddhism at Kopan Monastery, buying pashmina shawls and trinkets at Indra Chowk and Thamelâs markets and digging into steaming momos are great ways to enhance the experience.\r\n\r\nFrom courtyards of drying chillies and rice, incense wafting out of shrines, national museums, and contemporary Nepali art galleries to hobbit-sized workshops, bustling bazaars, rickshaws, Thukpa and Everest beer, Kathmandu offers something unique for every tourist, devotee, backpacker, history buff, foodie and shopaholic.\r\n', 'Kathmandu', '2a4eb88c-ec58-4e03-bc08-d8652a4ade4a.jfif', '2022-10-06', '2022-11-16', 5600),

This vast inland jungle is very peaceful and it\'s serene bays can be just as beautiful for families and backpackers.\r\n\r\nMost part of Koh Pha Ngan island is a mountainous jungle, and the rest of it is coconut trees and white sand beaches. Earlier, tourists usually preferred the more developed Koh Samui to their comfort. But since the mid eighties, due to the popularity of the full moon parties, Koh Pha Ngan has been a destination that\'s driving around twenty thousand people to itself. The coconut and fishing industries being the major source of income has now been taken over by the tourism of this island. Koh Pha Ngan has a lot of other things to offer including fishing trips, diving, kite-boarding, waterfalls and is also sometimes renowned as the a meditation centre.', 'Koh Pha Ngan', '25584bd6-449e-4cca-bbf9-24152110da40.jfif', '2022-11-10', '2022-12-06', 9400),

Spread across 4800 acres, Disneyland Paris is a combination of excitement and thrill due to a variety of domains of entertainment, ranging from exciting rides, shopping, dining and resorts, to a vast golf course. Disneyland Paris was opened in 1992 and saw around 15 million visitors annually. It is mainly composed of two theme parks - The Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park. Disneyland Paris is the most visited theme park in all of Europe, and the largest resort to be opened outside the United States.\r\n\r\nDisneyland Paris, the continentâs most popular theme park, undoubtedly dominates most familyâs holiday destinations list. Thereâs an enormous collection of attractions within the park, but the most memorable ones are Buzz Lightyearâs Laser Blast, Big Thunder Mountain and the Mad Hatterâs Tea Cups. However, these attractions are mainly preferred by younger children. Older children love the daring loops of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril. Thereâs also a small boat ride offered at the park.\r\n\r\nA sight that you wonât forget throughout your whole experience is the giant iconic Sleeping Beauty Castle, which is a replica of the one seen in the movie. Apart from being an unforgettable marvel, this castle acts as a compass for visitors who tend to get lost, as it is situated at the centre of the theme park. It also has a surprise in store for you, a dragon that lurks underneath it.
